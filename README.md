# Game Store (Front-End).
A little design for a website made using HTML 5 and CSS 3

# Summary.
From my little knowledge acquired in my web development lessons on Udemy, I'm making a couple of front-end and back-end projects and by the way, in this case I want to share publicly the little project about the design of a Game Store where you could find a navigation bar/section, the list of products, and another pages where you could find contact information, a product page preview and more.

# Other stuff.
Also you could find a link to this project hosted on Netlify's server: https://tiendadevideojuegos.netlify.app/<br>
