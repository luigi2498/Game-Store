# Game Store (Front-End and Back-End).
A little project about an **e-commerce** website made using **HTML5, CSS3, JS, JQUERY AJAX and PHP.**

# Summary.
From my little knowledge acquired in my web development lessons on Udemy, I'm making a couple of front-end and back-end projects and by the way, in this case I want to share publicly the little project about the design of a Game Store where you could find a navigation bar/section, the list of products, and another pages where you could find contact information, a product page preview and more.
About the latest update, you could test this project by your own, cause is now a little functional (not perfectly), but now you can go on the admins system to manage the whole database and add new more users, products, images, and all that kind of stuff (Read the set-up part to know how can you get started).

# How to set it up?
Firstable you need a database manager software, I used for this project **XAMPP**, where you could use your system on a **localhost** provided by **Apache** using **mySQL** for the database management and then also works with PHP (It also works with **WampServer** or other software like that).<br><br>
On this update you could find a **database file**, where has all the tables and information to have all ready for testing (**systemDB.sql** file).<br>

# Other stuff.
Also you could find a link to this project hosted on Netlify's server (Just like a demo, you can only watch the front-end part): **https://tiendadevideojuegos.netlify.app/**<br>
